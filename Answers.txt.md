    -Explain why a number data type added to a string data type returns a string.
    The plus + sign is treted as a string joining mechanism when one operand is a string and another a number.  Most programming languages convert a number to string before it concatenates.

    -Name a scenario where using the  == operator could cause a bug.
    When using the double equal operator (==) with a numeric and a string, this operator may convert it incorrectly because it may be trying to evaluate the number and the string which may be the same however they are different types of operators.

    -Name the operator(s) that you find confusing and explain why?
    The modulus operator  % has been confusing to me because as it gives me the remainder as it should, in my brain I expect to see the exact result of the division and I now know that it is showing the remainder.  

    -Explain a situation where you would use the Modulus operator and why.
    Using the modulus operator is effective with a loop counter, to repeat a certain pattern with the loop.  It can convert time measurements such as seconds to minutes to hours by extract the remainder for each unit of time.
